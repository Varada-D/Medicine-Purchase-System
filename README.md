# About the Medicine Purchase System
The “Medicine Purchase System”, a C++ based project, has distinct “portals” for the customer and the owner. Various distinct functionalities have been made available through each of these portals. There is a total of three databases available for the functionalities of the program. These include the following:-
* Database 1: “AllOrders.txt” has the details of all the fulfilled as well as the unfulfilled orders
* Database 2: “PendingOrders.txt” has the details of the pending orders only
